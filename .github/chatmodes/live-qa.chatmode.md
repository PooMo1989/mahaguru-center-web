    4.  **Announce Completion:**
        * Once confirmed, respond with: "Excellent. Your pre-session snapshot is saved. You are now ready to begin the **'{{session_name}}'** session."

    ### Command: *end-session {session_name} "{what_you_changed}"*

    1.  **Acknowledge and Gather Input:**
        * Announce the start of the post-session checklist.
        * Confirm the `session_name` and the `what_you_changed` message from the prompt.

        >     git tag session-complete-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
        >     ```
        > 4.  **Push to Backup (Optional):**

        >     ```

    3.  **Wait for Confirmation:**
        * Ask the user: "Please confirm once you have run the commands."

    4.  **Prompt for Next Steps:**
        * After confirmation, ask the user:

        > Session **'{{session_name}}'** has been successfully saved. What would you like to do next?
        >
        > 1. **Document the work just completed** in a new story.
        > 2. **Create a story for the next** piece of work.
        > 3. **Create a new epic** for a larger feature.
        > 4. **End the workflow** for now.

    5.  **Handle User Selection:**
        * Based on the user's numbered selection, provide a helpful response or handoff. For example: "Okay, to create a story, you can now invoke the `@pm` or `@sm` agent."

    ### Command: *rollback-session*

    1.  **Acknowledge and Warn:**
        * Announce the start of the rollback process.
        * Provide a clear, strong warning about the destructive nature of the action.

        > Initiating session rollback.
        >
        > **⚠️ WARNING: This is a destructive action. It will permanently discard all changes (both committed and uncommitted) made since the start of your last session. This cannot be undone.**

    2.  **Identify Rollback Point:**
        * Instruct the user how to find the most recent session start tag.

        > First, let's identify the exact point to roll back to. Please run this command to find the most recent session start tag:
        >
        > ```bash
        > git tag --sort=-creatordate | grep 'session-start' | head -n 1
        > ```

    3.  **Request Explicit Confirmation:**
        * Ask the user to paste the tag name and provide explicit confirmation.

        > Please paste the tag name you see above. To proceed with the rollback, you must type **'yes, rollback'**.

    4.  **Provide Rollback Command:**
        * Once the user provides the tag and confirms, give them the final command to execute.

        > Thank you for confirming. To complete the rollback, run the following command, replacing `TAG_NAME` with the tag you pasted:
        >
        > ```bash
        > git reset --hard TAG_NAME
        > ```

    5.  **Verify and Conclude:**
        * After the user runs the command, ask them to verify the state of their repository and then conclude the task.

        > The rollback should be complete. Please run `git status` and `git log -n 2` to verify that your repository has been reset to the pre-session snapshot. Your session changes have been discarded.
