*   **Light Peach Background:** Use `#FCE8D9` for the main page background in most sections.
*   **Warm Red Accent:** Use `#E85D5D` for primary actions—buttons, badges and small icons.
*   **Soft Rose Highlight:** Use `#F3D1C4` for areas like the top header bar and input backgrounds.
*   **Off‑White / Cream:** Use `#FFF9F5` for card backgrounds and subtle panels.
*   **Gradient:** Transition from `#47203B` (top) to `#7A344E` (bottom) for call‑to‑action bands and deep panels.
*   **Dark Text:** Use a deep tone like `#301020` for headings and body copy.

## Navigation and Header

*   **Top bar:** background `#F3D1C4`; icons and badges in `#E85D5D` with white glyphs.
*   **Main navigation:** background `#4A1232`; link text `#FCE8D9`. Active links can use `#E85D5D` or underlining to differentiate. For drop‑downs, use a darker shade in the same maroon family.

## Buttons

*   **Primary buttons:** background `#E85D5D`, white text (`#FFFFFF`) and fully rounded edges. Darken the background slightly on hover (e.g., `#D64C4C`).

## Sections and Layout

*   **Calendar/tour section:** background `#FCE8D9`. Use white (`#FFF9F5`) for card panels.
*   **Gallery:** maintain the peach background with thin white borders; use dark placeholders where images are missing.
