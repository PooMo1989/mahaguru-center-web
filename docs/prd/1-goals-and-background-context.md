# 1. Goals and Background Context

#### **Goals**

* To establish a professional and welcoming online presence for the Mahaguru Center.
* To clearly communicate the Mahaguru's unique spiritual journey and core teachings.
* To provide detailed information on all services and events, encouraging community engagement.
* To showcase the center's impactful projects and inspire financial support.
* To offer clear and accessible channels for volunteering, contact, and donations.

#### **Background Context**

The Mahaguru Center requires a new portfolio website to serve as its primary digital touchpoint. The immediate need is to structure over 20 years of spiritual teachings and community activities into an accessible and professional website. This site will act as an informational hub for new seekers, existing followers, and potential supporters, consolidating information about the Mahaguru, services, events, and special projects into a single, cohesive platform.
