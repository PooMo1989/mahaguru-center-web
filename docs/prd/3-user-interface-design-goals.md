# 3. User Interface Design Goals

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be serene, intuitive, and welcoming. It must create a sense of peace and clarity, guiding visitors effortlessly to the information or connection they seek. The design should feel clean, uncluttered, and reflective of the center's mindful ethos.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The interface will primarily use a simple, clear navigation structure. Key interactions will involve dynamic content loading within sections (e.g., the tabs on the Mahaguru and Donate pages) to provide rich information without overwhelming the user or requiring full page reloads.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

Based on the Project Brief, the core screens and views are: Homepage, Mahaguru, Services, Projects, Events, Contact Us, Book a Meetup, and Gen Alpha Academy.

#### **Branding**

*Assumption:* No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The design will use a calm, natural color scheme (e.g., earth tones, soft whites, muted accent colors) to create a peaceful aesthetic. This can be replaced if a formal brand guide exists.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

The website must be fully responsive, providing a seamless and high-quality experience on all major devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
