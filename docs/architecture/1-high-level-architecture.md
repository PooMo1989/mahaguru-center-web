# 1. High Level Architecture

#### **Technical Summary**
The architecture will be a full-stack, type-safe monorepo based on the T3 Stack. It will use **Next.js** for both the frontend and serverless API routes, **Prisma** for database access, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The entire application will be deployed and hosted on the **Vercel** platform, connected to a managed **PostgreSQL** database. This approach maximizes developer productivity and aligns with the project's goal of rapid, high-quality delivery.

#### **Platform and Infrastructure Choice**
* **Platform:** **Vercel**.
* **Database:** A managed **PostgreSQL** service (like Supabase or Neon).

#### **Repository Structure**
We will use a **Monorepo**.

#### **Architectural Patterns**
* **Jamstack**
* **Serverless**
* **Type-Safe API (tRPC)**
