# Story 4.2: Unified Admin Portal - Add Project Management Tab (Revised)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** to manage both Events and Projects from a single unified admin portal with tabbed navigation,
**so that** I have one consistent interface for all administrative tasks without switching between separate portals.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The existing admin portal at `/admin` must be enhanced with tabbed navigation showing "Events" and "Projects" tabs.
2. The "Events" tab must preserve all existing event management functionality without regression.
3. The "Projects" tab must display a list of projects with an "Add New Project" button.
4. Each project row must show key info (name, type, nature, goal amount, current amount) and have "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
5. The "Add" and "Edit" buttons must open a project form within the same portal.
6. The project form must contain all Project model fields with proper validation.
7. The `ProjectNature` field must be radio buttons ('Continuous'/'One-time') with conditional date field logic.
8. If 'Continuous' is selected, `StartDate` and `EndDate` fields must be **disabled**. If 'One-time' is selected, they must be **enabled**.
9. The "Save" button must handle both create and update operations.
10. After saving or deleting, the project list must update and show appropriate success messages.
11. Delete operations must show a confirmation dialog consistent with existing event deletion patterns.
12. All existing admin portal authentication, layout, and styling must be preserved.

## Dev Notes

### üèóÔ∏è UNIFIED ADMIN PORTAL ARCHITECTURE

**Core Principle**: Enhance the existing admin portal at `/admin` with tabbed navigation rather than creating separate admin portals. This maintains consistency, reduces duplication, and provides a better user experience.

**Existing Admin Infrastructure to Leverage**:
- **Admin Layout**: `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Authentication, header, navigation (REUSE)
- **Main Admin Page**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Current event management (ENHANCE with tabs)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js server-side protection (REUSE)
- **Admin Components**: EventList, EventForm, ConfirmationDialog patterns (ADAPT for Projects)
- **Styling**: Established Tailwind CSS admin patterns (CONSISTENT)

### üéØ TAB INTEGRATION STRATEGY

**Tab Implementation Approach**:
1. **Enhance `src/app/admin/page.tsx`** with React state for tab management
2. **Add tab navigation UI** using existing admin styling patterns
3. **Conditional rendering** of Events vs Projects content based on active tab
4. **Preserve event functionality** in "Events" tab (no regression)
5. **Add project functionality** in "Projects" tab (new feature)

**State Management**:
- Use React useState for active tab tracking
- Maintain separate state for Events and Projects forms
- Ensure tab switching doesn't lose unsaved form data
- Handle deep linking to specific tabs (optional enhancement)

### üîÑ COMPONENT REUSE PATTERNS

**ProjectList Component** (following EventList patterns):
- **File**: `src/components/admin/project-list.tsx`
- **Data Source**: Project tRPC router `getProjects` query
- **Display**: Responsive table/card layout with project info
- **Actions**: Edit and Delete buttons per row
- **Styling**: Match EventList styling for consistency

**ProjectForm Component** (following EventForm patterns):
- **File**: `src/components/admin/project-form.tsx`
- **Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod (same as EventForm)
- **API**: Project tRPC router create/update mutations
- **Modes**: Create and Edit modes in single component
- **Special Logic**: Conditional date fields based on ProjectNature

**ConfirmationDialog** (reuse existing):
- **File**: `src/components/admin/confirmation-dialog.tsx` (REUSE existing)
- **Purpose**: Project deletion confirmation
- **Content**: Adapt messaging for project context

### üìä PROJECT MODEL INTEGRATION

**From Story 4.1 API Foundation**:
- **Router**: `src/server/api/routers/project.ts` (completed)
- **Types**: Full TypeScript integration via tRPC
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for form validation
- **Operations**: getProjects, getProject, createProject, updateProject, deleteProject

**Form Field Mapping**:
```typescript
// Project form fields (from Story 4.1 API)
interface ProjectFormData {
  projectName: string;
  description: string;
  photos: string[];
  donationGoalAmount: number;
  currentDonationAmount: number;
  projectType: string;
  projectNature: 'Continuous' | 'One-time';
  startDate?: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  donationLinkTarget: 'Daily Dana' | 'Poya Day' | 'Special Projects';
}
```

### üìã PROJECT BRIEF REQUIREMENTS

- **Authentication Reuse**: Leverage existing NextAuth.js admin protection in layout
- **TypeScript Strict**: All new components must maintain strict type safety
- **tRPC Integration**: Use Project router from Story 4.1 for all API calls
- **Form Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod schemas matching backend validation
- **Responsive Design**: Admin interface must work on mobile devices
- **State Management**: React state for UI, tRPC for server state
- **Component Patterns**: Follow established EventList/EventForm component architecture

### üìÅ FILE LOCATIONS

src/components/admin/project-form.test.tsx (new)
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Tab switching preserves form state
- Project CRUD operations work correctly
- Conditional date field logic functions properly
- Confirmation dialogs work for project deletion

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 21, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD** - The implementation successfully delivers on all acceptance criteria with high-quality code following established patterns. The unified admin portal approach is architecturally sound, maintaining consistency with existing event management while properly extending functionality for project management.

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent pattern consistency between Event and Project components
- Clean separation of concerns with proper React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Robust TypeScript integration with tRPC for type safety
- Comprehensive test coverage following established patterns
- Proper conditional UI logic for ProjectNature (Continuous vs One-time)
- Good error handling and loading states throughout

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/components/admin/project-form.tsx`
- **Change**: Improved number field handling in form validation and submission
- **Why**: The original implementation forced empty string inputs to 0 immediately, which prevented proper user input flow and validation error display
- **How**: Modified `handleInputChange` to preserve empty strings for better UX, then properly convert to numbers in validation and submission with explicit type checking

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ‚úì Excellent adherence to TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, and Prettier
- **Project Structure**: ‚úì Perfect alignment with established component patterns and file organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ‚úì Comprehensive test coverage at appropriate levels (unit tests for components, integration via admin page)
