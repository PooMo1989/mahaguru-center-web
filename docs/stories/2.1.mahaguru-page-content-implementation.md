## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.5 (Gen Alpha Academy Basic) provided excellent patterns for:
- Page structure: Navigation + main content sections with proper responsive layout
- Content organization: Clear section-based structure with semantic HTML
- Tailwind CSS usage: Consistent styling patterns for typography and responsive design
- Test patterns: Comprehensive coverage mapping to acceptance criteria with both positive and negative assertions

### Content Requirements
[Source: Project Brief Page 2: Mahaguru Page]
The Mahaguru page must contain the following five sections with exact, unabridged text:

**Section 1: The Formative Years: An Era of Seeking**
> This section would chronicle the Mahaguru's early life and the initial period of spiritual exploration and quest for truth.

**Section 2: The Dawn of Realization: An Era of Fulfillment**
> Here, we would detail the pivotal moments of spiritual attainment and profound insight.

**Section 3: Insightful Experimentation: Understanding the Human Mind**
> A phase dedicated to analyzing human nature and discovering the most effective methods for disseminating the Dhamma.

**Section 4: A Framework for Wisdom: Systematizing the Teachings**
> Detailing the process of organizing the Dhamma into structured collections, creating personalized paths for individuals based on their unique dispositions.

**Section 5: The Enduring Legacy: A System for All Beings**
> Focusing on the creation of a timeless and accessible system, designed for all to rely on the teachings themselves, ensuring a legacy beyond the individual.

### Technical Specifications
**Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript 5+ [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3+ for responsive design [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
**File Location**: `src/app/mahaguru/page.tsx` [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]
**Component Integration**: Navigation component from `src/components/navigation.tsx` [Source: existing implementation]

### Project Structure Alignment
Following established pattern from stories 1.2-1.5:
- Route: `/mahaguru` (already exists with placeholder content)
- Component structure: Navigation + main content sections
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS Grid/Flexbox patterns
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy

### Testing Requirements
**Framework**: Vitest [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Target Coverage**: 80% for critical logic [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test File Location**: `src/app/mahaguru/page.test.tsx`
**Test Requirements**:
- Component rendering and all five sections content display
- Responsive layout behavior testing
- Verification of exact text content from Project Brief
- Navigation integration testing
- Scrollable content format validation

### Technical Constraints
**TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
**Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier compliance [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
**Type Safety**: Absolute type safety requirement [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- The `/mahaguru` route directory already exists in `src/app/mahaguru/`
- Current `page.tsx` contains placeholder content that needs to be replaced
- Navigation component already includes "Mahaguru" link routing to `/mahaguru`
- No structural conflicts found between epic requirements and architecture

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
GitHub Copilot (dev agent)

### File List
- **Modified**: `src/app/mahaguru/page.tsx` - Replaced placeholder content with five life stages sections using exact text from Project Brief
- **Created**: `src/app/mahaguru/page.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite covering all acceptance criteria

### Completion Notes
- All five life stages implemented with exact text from Project Brief Section 2: Mahaguru Page
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS with proper prose classes and container structure
- Semantic HTML structure with h1 title and h2 section headings for proper hierarchy
- Linear scrollable format with visual separators between sections
- Comprehensive test coverage including content validation, responsive layout, and accessibility
- ESLint compliance achieved (escaped apostrophe in content)
- Build validation successful - all pages compile and render correctly

### Debug Log References
- Fixed ESLint error: Escaped apostrophe in "Mahaguru's" → "Mahaguru&apos;s"
- Updated routing test to match new page title from "About Mahaguru" to "Mahaguru" 
- Corrected negative test case to avoid false positive for legitimate content

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 18, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality.** The Mahaguru page demonstrates clean, maintainable code following Next.js 14+ and TypeScript best practices. The component structure is well-organized with proper separation of concerns, semantic HTML, and consistent Tailwind CSS styling patterns. The implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria with precise content matching from the Project Brief.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The implementation already follows best practices:

- **Clean Component Structure**: Proper TSX component with clear separation of Navigation and main content
- **Semantic HTML**: Correct use of `<main>`, `<section>`, and heading hierarchy (h1 → h2)
- **Responsive Design**: Appropriate Tailwind classes for mobile-first responsive layout
- **Content Fidelity**: Exact text content matching Project Brief requirements

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ TypeScript strict mode compliance, ESLint clean, proper formatting
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Correct file location (`src/app/mahaguru/page.tsx`) and naming conventions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 20 test cases covering all requirements
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

All items already addressed during development:

- [x] Five life stages content implemented with exact Project Brief text
- [x] Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS applied correctly
- [x] Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- [x] Linear scrollable format with visual separators implemented
- [x] Comprehensive test suite covering all acceptance criteria

### Performance Considerations

**Optimized for performance:**
- Static component with no client-side JavaScript overhead
- Minimal CSS footprint using Tailwind utilities
- Semantic HTML structure supports efficient rendering
- No external dependencies or API calls
- Content is text-only, ensuring fast load times
