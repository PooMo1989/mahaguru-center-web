## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3, the Contact Us page at `src/app/contact/page.tsx` has been successfully implemented with a Volunteer section and working form functionality. The page uses Tailwind CSS for styling, proper semantic HTML structure, and comprehensive form validation. The Radix UI component library has been successfully used in Story 2.2 for implementing tabbed interfaces on the Mahaguru page. The same tabbed interface pattern should be replicated for the donation tabs. The existing page structure should be extended, not replaced. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.contact-us-page-volunteer-section.md and docs/stories/2.2.mahaguru-page-interactive-tabs.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript 5+ [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **UI Components**: Radix UI is the specified component library for tabbed interfaces [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3+ for responsive design and consistent form styling [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Form Handling**: Client-side form handling with validation - no backend integration required for this story
- **Tabs Component**: Use Radix UI Tabs component following same pattern as Story 2.2 Mahaguru page implementation

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story. Form data will be handled client-side with simple state management. The three donation funds (Daily Dana, Poya Day Event, Special Projects) will be handled as static content with form state management for each fund type.

### API Specifications
No API interactions required for this story - form submission will show success message without backend processing. This is a frontend-only implementation focusing on UI/UX and tabbed interface functionality.

### File Locations
- **Target File**: `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Extend existing implementation with Donate section [Source: docs/architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- **Component Location**: Main implementation should be in the page component, following existing patterns [Source: docs/architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- **Test Location**: Extend existing test file `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx` with donation tab tests [Source: docs/architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Project Structure Notes
The existing Contact Us page at `src/app/contact/page.tsx` should be extended with the new Donate section. The route structure `/contact` is already established. Implementation should add the Donate section below the existing Volunteer section, maintaining the page's existing layout and navigation patterns. No structural conflicts identified.

### Donation Section Content
Exact text from Project Brief to be used for each tab:

**Daily Dana Tab:**
> "Your generosity helps keep our physical sanctuary, the Arahathmaga Spiritual Center, open and available to all. Contributions to this fund cover our essential monthly expenses, including staff salaries, utility bills, and daily dhana, ensuring our center remains a welcoming space for contemplation and learning."
[Source: docs/Project-Brief.md#Page 5: Contact Us Page]

**Poya Day Event Tab:**
> "Support our signature monthly Dhamma Discussion, a cornerstone event held on the full moon Poya day that draws over a hundred seekers. Your donation helps us facilitate this profound session with Mahaguru and continue offering it to our growing community."
[Source: docs/Project-Brief.md#Page 5: Contact Us Page]

**Special Projects Tab:**
> "Contribute to our visionary initiatives that extend the Dhamma in new ways. Your support for our special projects helps fund the development of the revolutionary 'AI Guru', the 'Beyond Words' sacred text translation, and our other innovative outreach programs."
[Source: docs/Project-Brief.md#Page 5: Contact Us Page]

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Must maintain strict type safety [Source: docs/architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **ESLint Compliance**: Code must pass linting without errors [Source: docs/architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **Form Accessibility**: Forms must be properly labeled and keyboard navigable
- **Client-side Only**: No backend integration required for this story - focus on UI/UX implementation
- **Radix UI Integration**: Use Radix UI Tabs component for consistent tabbed interface implementation

### Testing
- **Framework**: Vitest for unit testing [Source: docs/architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical logic [Source: docs/architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Standards**: Pragmatic balance of unit and integration tests [Source: docs/architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test File Location**: Extend existing tests in `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx`
- **Tab Testing**: Validate tab rendering, switching behavior, and content display
- **Form Testing**: Validate form rendering, field interactions, validation, and submission flow for each donation fund

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 20, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is functionally complete and successfully meets all acceptance criteria. The donation tabbed interface is properly implemented using Radix UI components with correct content display for each fund (Daily Dana, Poya Day Event, Special Projects). Form validation is comprehensive with proper error handling and success messaging. The component demonstrates good React patterns with proper state management and event handling.

However, there are significant issues in the test suite that need attention before this story can be considered fully ready for production release.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed accessibility test to expect correct number of heading elements
  - **Why**: The test was incorrectly expecting only one h2 element when there are actually two (Volunteer and Donate sections)
  - **How**: Updated assertion to check for 2 level-2 headings using `toHaveLength(2)`

- **File**: `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added timeout configurations to failing async tests
  - **Why**: Several tab interaction tests were timing out due to default 5-second limit
  - **How**: Added `{ timeout: 10000 }` parameter to waitFor calls for tab switching tests

- **File**: `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed donation form field test selectors
  - **Why**: Tests were using ambiguous selectors that matched multiple elements on the page
  - **How**: Updated selectors to be more specific and avoid conflicts between volunteer and donation forms

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, proper ESLint compliance, clean code structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established Next.js app directory pattern
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test suite has multiple failures that need resolution
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria are functionally implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items handled during review, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Fixed heading count test to match actual page structure
- [x] Added timeout configurations to prevent test timing issues
- [x] Updated test selectors to be more specific for donation forms
- [ ] Resolve remaining test failures for tab content switching (16 failing tests remain)
- [ ] Fix test selector ambiguity between volunteer and donation form fields
- [ ] Consider making form field IDs more unique to improve accessibility
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation tests for donation amount edge cases
- [ ] Test tab content persistence across tab switches

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This is a client-side only implementation with proper input validation for donation amounts, email format validation, and no sensitive data handling. Form submissions show success messages without actual backend processing as specified.

### Performance Considerations

Implementation uses efficient React state management and Radix UI components which are optimized for performance. No performance bottlenecks identified. Tab switching is immediate and form interactions are responsive.

### Files Modified During Review

- `src/app/contact/page.test.tsx` - Fixed test selectors and timeout issues

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.4-contact-us-page-donation-tabs.yml

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

The implementation is functionally complete and meets all acceptance criteria, but the test suite needs significant work before this story can be considered production-ready. While the feature works correctly in manual testing, having 16 failing automated tests creates a reliability concern and blocks confidence in future changes.

Priority should be given to fixing the test selector issues and ensuring all tab interaction tests pass consistently. The core functionality is solid, but proper test coverage is essential for maintainability.
