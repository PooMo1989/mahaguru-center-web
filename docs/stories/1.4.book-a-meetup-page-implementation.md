### Call-to-Action Button Requirements
- All buttons must be functional with placeholder links
- Consistent styling with existing services page CTA buttons
- Use `data-testid` attributes for testing
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Testing Requirements

- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical logic [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location**: Co-located with component file
- **Testing Pattern**: Unit tests for component rendering, content verification, and interaction testing

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified between epic requirements and architecture. The `/mahaguru-meetup` route aligns with existing project structure pattern seen in `/services`, `/contact`, `/events`, etc.
