## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5, the basic Gen Alpha Academy page was implemented with a "Coming Soon" message and basic content structure. The page successfully established:
- Route at `/gen-alpha-academy` with proper Navigation component integration
- Responsive layout foundation using Tailwind CSS
- Basic content sections (Hero, Mission, Four Pillars, Coming Soon)
- Comprehensive test coverage (14 unit tests) with 100% test coverage
- Proper accessibility and responsive design patterns

Key implementation learnings from Story 1.5:
- Component structure is well-established and follows project patterns
- Navigation integration works correctly with Services page linking
- Four Pillars section layout (2x2 grid) is responsive and functional
- Test patterns are comprehensive and should be extended for full content

### Technical Architecture

**Page Location and Structure**:
- File location: `src/app/gen-alpha-academy/page.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- Route: `/gen-alpha-academy` (linked from Services page, not main navigation)
- Uses Navigation component with responsive layout structure
- Test file location: `src/app/gen-alpha-academy/page.test.tsx`
[Source: docs/stories/1.5.gen-alpha-academy-basic-page-implementation.md#Technical Specifications]

**Framework and Styling**:

- Uses standard HTML semantic elements with proper accessibility attributes
[Source: docs/architecture/13-coding-standards.md]

**External Service Integration**:
The application uses simple redirects to external services:
- Registration System: For 'Gen Alpha Academy' sign-ups
- WhatsApp: For inquiries
- No direct backend-to-backend API integrations required
