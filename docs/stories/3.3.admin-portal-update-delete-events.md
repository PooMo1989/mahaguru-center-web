# Story 3.3: Admin Portal (Update & Delete Events)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** to be able to edit the details of existing events and delete them from the admin portal,
**so that** I can maintain accurate event information and remove outdated events efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each event in the admin list must have an "Edit" and a "Delete" button.
2. Clicking "Edit" must open a form pre-populated with that event's data.
3. The "Save Changes" button must send updated data to the API.
4. After an update, the list must show the new information.
5. Clicking "Delete" must trigger a confirmation prompt.
6. If confirmed, the event must be deleted via the API.
7. After deletion, the event must disappear from the list.
8. The admin portal must maintain all required event fields as specified in the PRD: Name, Description, Category, Date, and Photos. [Source: prd/2-requirements.md#FR2]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.2 successfully implemented the complete admin portal foundation with authentication, event list display, and event creation functionality. The existing admin portal at `src/app/admin/page.tsx` already has authentication protection via `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`, EventList component for displaying events, and EventForm component for creating events. The Event tRPC router is fully functional with all CRUD operations including `updateEvent` and `deleteEvent` mutations that were implemented in Story 3.1. The admin portal uses proper state management and refresh patterns after event creation. [Source: Previous Story 3.2 completion]

### API Integration
**Event tRPC Router**: The admin portal will utilize the existing Event tRPC router implemented in Story 3.1. Available mutations: `updateEvent` (accepts event ID and updated data with full input validation), `deleteEvent` (accepts event ID). Available queries: `getEvents` (with filtering support), `getEvent` (for fetching single event details). All endpoints use TypeScript strict mode with Zod validation schemas. Router location: `src/server/api/routers/event.ts` integrated into main router. [Source: Previous Story 3.1, architecture/5-api-specification.md#Event Router]

### Component Architecture
**Existing Components**: Leverage existing `EventList` component in `src/components/admin/event-list.tsx` and `EventForm` component in `src/components/admin/event-form.tsx`. The EventForm component should be enhanced to support both create and edit modes with conditional logic for pre-population. Must use React Server Components where appropriate and Client Components for interactive elements (forms, modals, real-time updates). Integration with tRPC client for type-safe API communication. [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md, architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

**UI Component Library**: Use Radix UI for accessible confirmation dialogs and enhanced date/time picker components. All styling must use Tailwind CSS 3+ with responsive design patterns. Form components should follow established UI patterns from Story 3.2. [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- **Admin Page**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Existing admin portal page to be enhanced [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- **EventList Component**: `src/components/admin/event-list.tsx` - Existing component to add action buttons
- **EventForm Component**: `src/components/admin/event-form.tsx` - Existing component to enhance for edit mode
- **Confirmation Dialog**: `src/components/admin/confirmation-dialog.tsx` - New reusable confirmation component
- **Test Files**: 
  - `src/components/admin/event-list.test.tsx` - Enhanced tests for action buttons
  - `src/components/admin/event-form.test.tsx` - Enhanced tests for edit mode
  - `src/components/admin/confirmation-dialog.test.tsx` - New tests for confirmation dialog
  [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Data Models and Validation
**Event Model Structure**: Event table already defined in database schema with fields: id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), name (TEXT), description (TEXT), category (TEXT), eventDate (TIMESTAMP), photos (TEXT[]), createdAt, updatedAt timestamps. All form validation must use the same Zod schemas as the existing tRPC router to ensure consistency. [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#Event Table]

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All enhanced admin components must maintain strict type safety [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **Server-Side Security**: All admin routes already protected by authentication on the server side [Source: architecture/15-security.md]
- **tRPC Integration**: Must use existing tRPC patterns for type-safe client-server communication [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced admin portal must remain functional on desktop browsers with responsive considerations [Source: AC requirement]
- **Real-time Updates**: Event list must refresh automatically after both update and delete operations without full page reload

### Data Flow
**Event Update Flow**: Admin clicks Edit → Form pre-populated with existing data → Client-side validation → tRPC updateEvent mutation → Server-side validation → Prisma database update → Success response → UI refresh. **Event Delete Flow**: Admin clicks Delete → Confirmation dialog → Confirm action → tRPC deleteEvent mutation → Server-side validation → Prisma database deletion → Success response → UI refresh with event removed.

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on both client and server sides using existing Zod schemas
- Protected routes already implemented with NextAuth.js session verification
- Secure handling of event IDs in update and delete operations
- CSRF protection through NextAuth.js built-in security measures
- Confirmation prompts for destructive actions (delete)

### UI/UX Requirements
**Edit Form Behavior**: The edit form must pre-populate all fields with existing event data, including the date/time picker showing the current eventDate. Form validation must provide clear feedback for invalid inputs. Success and error states must be clearly communicated to the user.

**Delete Confirmation**: The delete confirmation dialog must clearly identify which event is being deleted (show event name and date) and require explicit confirmation before proceeding. The dialog should follow accessibility best practices with proper focus management.

### Content Requirements
**Required Event Fields**: Per PRD Functional Requirement FR2, the Events system must support a backend portal where administrators can create, update, and manage events with the following mandatory fields: Name (TEXT), Description (TEXT), Category (TEXT), Date (TIMESTAMP), and Photos (TEXT[]). All edit forms and update operations must support these exact fields to maintain compliance with the PRD specification. [Source: prd/2-requirements.md#FR2]

**User-Friendly Interface Requirement**: Per Non-Functional Requirement NFR2, the backend portal for managing events must be user-friendly for non-technical administrators. The edit and delete functionality must maintain this usability standard with clear visual indicators, intuitive workflows, and helpful feedback messages. [Source: prd/2-requirements.md#NFR2]

**System Integration**: The admin portal functionality must integrate seamlessly with the public Events page requirements (FR3) where events are automatically categorized as "Upcoming" or "Past Events Archive" based on their date. Any updates to event dates must consider this automatic categorization system. [Source: prd/2-requirements.md#FR3]

### Testing
**Framework**: Vitest for unit and integration testing [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical admin logic including edit and delete functionality [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Scenarios**: 
- Edit button opens form with correct pre-populated data
- Edit form submission updates event and refreshes list
- Delete button triggers confirmation dialog with correct event info
- Delete confirmation removes event and refreshes list
- Error handling for both update and delete operations
- Form validation for edit operations maintains existing standards
