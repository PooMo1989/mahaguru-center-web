# Story 1.1: Project Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial project structure and repository,
**so that** we have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository for the project must be initialized.
2. The repository must follow the agreed-upon **Monorepo** structure, with distinct packages/directories for the `frontend` and `backend` applications.
3. The `frontend` application must be initialized with a standard framework and its basic dependencies.
4. The `backend` application (as a **Monolith**) must be initialized with a standard framework and its basic dependencies.
5. Basic development tooling (e.g., a linter for code quality) must be configured at the root of the monorepo.
6. A basic `README.md` file must be created with instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project locally.
7. The initial, empty applications must be successfully deployed to a staging/development environment to confirm the deployment pipeline is functional.

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]
The monorepo must follow this exact structure:
```
/
├── prisma/                 # Database schemas and migrations
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/               # Next.js app router pages
│   │   ├── api/           # API routes
│   │   │   └── trpc/      # tRPC endpoint configuration
│   │   ├── (pages)/       # Page components and routes
│   │   ├── admin/         # Admin interface pages
│   │   └── layout.tsx     # Root layout component
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/              # Utility libraries and helpers
│   └── server/           # Server-side code
│       └── api/          # tRPC API logic
│           └── routers/  # API route handlers
├── package.json          # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Absolute type safety required
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Must be configured at project root
- **Data Access**: All data access must use Prisma and tRPC layers exclusively
- **Environment Variables**: Must be handled securely with proper validation
- **Type Safety**: Critical rule - no `any` types allowed

### Deployment and Infrastructure
[Source: architecture/11-infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **Hosting**: Vercel with Git-based CI/CD pipeline
- **Branching Strategy**: 
  - Feature branches → Preview Deployments
  - `staging` branch → Staging Environment
  - `main` branch → Production Environment
- **Rollback**: Vercel provides instant rollback capability
- **Environment Setup**: Must test both staging and production deployment paths

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical logic
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for key user flows (setup for future stories)
- **Test Organization**: Pragmatic balance of unit and integration tests
- **Test File Location**: Adjacent to source files or in `__tests__` directories

### Security Considerations
- Environment variables must use Next.js env validation
- Database credentials must be properly secured
- tRPC endpoints must implement proper type safety
- Authentication setup must follow NextAuth.js best practices

### Performance Requirements
- Initial page load optimization with Next.js SSR/SSG
- Database connection pooling with Prisma
- Proper caching strategies for static assets
- Responsive design implementation with Tailwind CSS

## Testing
### Testing Standards for Story 1.1
[Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest must be configured for the project
- **Test Coverage**: Set up coverage reporting with 80% target
- **Test Types**: Focus on unit tests for initial setup validation
- **Test File Location**: Tests should be co-located with source files or in `__tests__` directories
- **Testing Requirements**: 
  - Test environment variable loading
  - Test database connection setup
  - Test tRPC client/server configuration
  - Test basic API endpoint functionality
  - Verify TypeScript compilation with strict mode
