## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion: Excellent foundation established with Next.js 15, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS 4, and comprehensive testing setup using Vitest. All tooling and deployment pipeline confirmed working. [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Project Structure Information
Based on established source tree, new components should be placed in:
- Navigation component: `src/components/` directory
- Page files: `src/app/` using App Router structure
- Existing layout.tsx provides the root layout structure [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]

### Content Requirements
[Source: UI/UX Specification]
The homepage must be built with the following sections and content, not placeholders:

**1. Hero Section:**
- A large, visually striking area with a powerful, high-quality background image.
- Prominently feature an evocative quote or a strong headline.
- Include a single, clear call-to-action button.

**2. Introduction Section:**
- A short, welcoming paragraph introducing the center and its core mission.

**3. Featured Pages Section:**
- A grid of four visual cards that link to the main areas of the website:
    - Card 1: About Mahaguru (Links to Mahaguru page)
    - Card 2: Our Services (Links to Services page)
    - Card 3: Monthly Dhamma Discussion (Links to Events page)
    - Card 4: Our Community Projects (Links to Projects page)

### Technical Standards and Constraints
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must use strict TypeScript typing [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS 4 for all styling, following responsive-first approach [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Components**: Use Radix UI components for accessible UI primitives [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Routing**: Use Next.js 15 App Router for all page routing [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - this is a static frontend implementation. [Source: architecture/3-data-models.md]

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story - static page implementation only.

### Component Specifications
Navigation component requirements:
- Must be responsive (mobile-first design)
- Should use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Links: Mahaguru, Services, Projects, Events, Contact Us
- Implement mobile hamburger menu for smaller screens
- Style with "serene and welcoming" visual theme using Tailwind CSS

### File Locations
Based on established project structure:
- Main homepage: `src/app/page.tsx` (replace existing T3 content)
- Navigation component: `src/components/navigation.tsx` 
- Placeholder pages: `src/app/(pages)/[page-name]/page.tsx`
- Layout updates: `src/app/layout.tsx` (if needed)
- Test files: Co-located with components following established pattern [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
Following established testing strategy:
- Unit tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Target 80% code coverage for new components
- Test files should be co-located with components
- Focus on component rendering, user interactions, and navigation functionality
- Responsive design testing across breakpoints [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Version 5+ with strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 only, no custom CSS
- **Components**: Radix UI for accessible primitives
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Performance**: Follow Next.js best practices for optimal loading [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]

### Security Considerations
No specific security requirements for this static page implementation. Follow existing patterns for environment variable handling if any configuration is needed. [Source: architecture/15-security.md]

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- Navigation component unit tests (rendering, click handlers, responsive behavior)
- Homepage layout integration tests
- Routing functionality tests for all navigation links
- Responsive design validation across screen sizes
- Accessibility testing for navigation components

### Coverage Targets
- 80% coverage minimum for all new components
- Test all user interaction scenarios
- Validate responsive breakpoints

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 18, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates best practices throughout. The code exhibits clean architecture, proper TypeScript typing, responsive design, and comprehensive test coverage. The navigation component uses Radix UI primitives correctly for accessibility, and the homepage layout follows modern responsive design patterns.

### Review Date: September 18, 2025 (CRITICAL FOLLOW-UP)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### **CRITICAL FINDING**: Responsive Design Bug Assertion **REJECTED**

After comprehensive analysis of the implementation, I must **REJECT** the assertion that this story contains a critical responsive design bug. The evidence shows:

**Navigation Component (FULLY RESPONSIVE)**:
- ✅ Desktop: `hidden md:block` navigation with proper spacing
- ✅ Mobile: `md:hidden` hamburger menu with Radix UI DropdownMenu
- ✅ Responsive container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`

**Homepage Layout (FULLY RESPONSIVE)**:
- ✅ Hero typography: `text-5xl md:text-6xl` (responsive scaling)
- ✅ Grid system: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` (correct breakpoints)
- ✅ Container spacing: Progressive padding with `px-4`, `sm:px-6`, `lg:px-8`

**Test Coverage Validation**:
- ✅ 20 tests passing including responsive design validation
- ✅ Mobile menu trigger tests confirm functionality
- ✅ Grid responsiveness explicitly tested and validated

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - The responsive design implementation follows Tailwind CSS best practices with proper mobile-first approach. All breakpoints are correctly implemented using `md:` and `lg:` prefixes, and the mobile navigation uses proper accessibility patterns with Radix UI.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The responsive implementation already follows best practices.

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**AC 4**: ✓ "Fully responsive layout rendering correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile" 
- **Mobile** (< 768px): Single column, hamburger menu, scaled typography
- **Tablet** (768px-1024px): Two-column grid, responsive navigation
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): Four-column grid, full navigation bar

All responsive requirements are **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and tested.

### Compliance Check

- **Responsive Design**: ✓ Mobile-first Tailwind CSS implementation with proper breakpoints
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Responsive behavior validated in test suite
- **Accessibility**: ✓ Mobile menu uses proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Including AC #4 which is fully responsive

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Coverage**: Responsive design properly tested with mobile menu validation and grid responsiveness checks
**Quality**: Tests verify mobile menu trigger visibility and responsive grid classes
**Validation**: All 20 tests passing confirms responsive implementation works correctly

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns with responsive design implementation.

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Responsive design uses efficient CSS classes without performance impact. Mobile menu implementation is lightweight and accessible.

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

- **Responsiveness**: ✓ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - contradicts the bug assertion
- **Accessibility**: ✓ Mobile menu has proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Browser Compatibility**: ✓ Tailwind CSS responsive utilities have wide support

### Files Modified During Review

None - no modifications were necessary as the responsive design is correctly implemented.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-homepage-implementation.yml

### **FINAL DETERMINATION**

**✓ STORY APPROVED - NO RESPONSIVE BUG EXISTS**

The assertion of a "critical responsive design bug" is **INVALID**. The implementation demonstrates proper responsive design with:
- Correct Tailwind CSS breakpoint usage
- Mobile-first design approach  
- Functional mobile navigation
- Responsive grid layouts
- Passing test validation

**Recommended Status**: ✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria including responsive design are fully implemented and validated.
