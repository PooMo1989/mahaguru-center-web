# Story 3.4: Frontend Events Page & Automated Filtering

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to view an Events page and sidebar that automatically show upcoming and past events in the correct sections,
**so that** the information is always current and relevant.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A public "Events" page and a reusable "Upcoming Events" sidebar component must be created.
2. The components must fetch **dynamic** event data from the API.
3. The "Events" page must display a **static "Recurring Events" section**.
4. The "Upcoming Events" sidebar must display events with a future date.
5. The "Past Events Archive" must display events with a date in the past.
6. Each **dynamic** event displayed must show its details including date and time.
7. If a section has no dynamic events, a user-friendly message must be shown.
8. The page and sidebar must be fully responsive.
9. **Upcoming events must be ordered by date (earliest first)** for chronological relevance.
10. **Past events must be ordered by date (most recent first)** for easy access to latest archived events.
11. Each dynamic event must display all required fields: **Name, Description, Category, Event Date/Time, and Photos**.
12. The Events page must be accessible from the main navigation as specified in FR1.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1-3.3 have successfully implemented the complete Events backend API foundation with tRPC routers and database schema, plus the admin portal for CRUD operations. The Event data model is established with fields: id, name, description, category, eventDate, photos, createdAt, updatedAt. Admin portal demonstrates successful tRPC integration patterns for API calls. Frontend should follow the same tRPC client patterns established in admin portal implementation. [Source: docs/stories/3.1-3.3]

### Data Models
**Event Model Structure** (Available from API):
- `id`: Primary key (TEXT)
- `name`: Event name (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `description`: Event description (TEXT, NOT NULL) 
- `category`: Event category (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `eventDate`: Event date and time (TIMESTAMP(3), NOT NULL) - **Use for filtering**
- `photos`: Array of photo URLs (TEXT[])
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp (TIMESTAMP(3))
- `updatedAt`: Update timestamp (TIMESTAMP(3))
[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#Event Table]

### API Specifications
**tRPC Event Router endpoints** (Available from Story 3.1):
- `getEvents`: Query supporting optional filtering (past/upcoming based on eventDate)
- `getEvent`: Query for retrieving single event by ID
- Router available at: `src/server/api/routers/event.ts`
- Must use tRPC client patterns for type-safe API calls
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#Event Router, docs/stories/3.1.events-backend-api-foundation.md]

### Component Specifications
**Static Recurring Events Content** (Required for Events page):
- **Monthly Dhamma Discussion**: "Our signature monthly Dhamma Discussion is a cornerstone event held on the full moon Poya day, drawing over a hundred curious seekers of truth. The session begins with a profound talk by Mahaguru, followed by co-facilitated breakout discussions with Rev. Bhaddiya and Nevil Guru to explore the teachings more deeply."
- **Weekly Clarity Q&A**: "Join our interactive Weekly Clarity Q&A session, a supportive space for both new and experienced followers to find answers. Whether you have questions about your personal practice or seek to clarify concepts from our Dhamma discussions, this is your opportunity to engage directly with our facilitators. The session is expertly guided by Rev. Dodangoda Bhaddiya and Nevil Guru, with Mahaguru often in attendance to provide deeper insights where needed."
[Source: docs/stories/3.1.events-backend-api-foundation.md#Content Requirements]

### Content and Structure Requirements
**Dynamic Event Display Requirements** (Based on tRPC API and PRD):
- **Required Event Fields Display**: All dynamic events must show Name, Description, Category, Event Date/Time, and Photos array [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#Event Table, prd/2-requirements.md#FR2]
- **Event Ordering Requirements**: 
  - Upcoming events: Ordered by eventDate ASC (earliest first) for chronological relevance [Source: src/server/api/routers/event.ts#getEvents ordering logic]
  - Past events: Ordered by eventDate DESC (most recent first) for easy access to latest archived events [Source: src/server/api/routers/event.ts#getEvents ordering logic]
- **Date Filtering Logic**: Filter based on eventDate comparison with current timestamp using tRPC getEvents filter parameter ("upcoming", "past", "all") [Source: src/server/api/routers/event.ts#eventFilterInput]
- **Section Structure Requirements**:
  - Static "Recurring Events" section (always visible with predefined content)
  - Dynamic "Upcoming Events" section (filtered events with future dates)
  - Dynamic "Past Events Archive" section (filtered events with past dates)
  - Empty state handling for sections with no dynamic events [Source: prd/5-epic-story-breakdown.md#Story 3.4]

### File Locations
- **Events Page**: `src/app/(pages)/events/page.tsx` - Main public Events page [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- **Sidebar Component**: `src/components/UpcomingEventsSidebar.tsx` - Reusable sidebar component [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]
- **Test Files**: `src/test/` directory - Component and integration tests [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **tRPC Client**: Use existing tRPC setup from `src/trpc/` for API calls [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Strategy**: Vitest for unit and integration testing with 80% coverage target for critical logic
- Component rendering tests for Events page and sidebar
- API integration tests for event fetching and filtering
- Date filtering logic tests (upcoming vs past events)
- Responsive design tests for multiple screen sizes
- Empty state and error handling tests
**Test File Location**: Tests should be co-located with components or in `src/test/` directory
[Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All components must have proper type safety with Event model types [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **tRPC Integration**: Must use tRPC client for all API calls - no direct fetch/axios [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
- **Tailwind CSS**: All styling must use Tailwind classes, responsive design mandatory [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Next.js 14+ Patterns**: Use App Router structure, Server/Client components appropriately [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Date Filtering Logic**: Filter events by comparing eventDate with current timestamp for upcoming/past categorization [Source: docs/stories/3.1.events-backend-api-foundation.md]
- **Environment Variables**: No additional environment variables required - story uses existing tRPC client setup for API access [Source: Existing .env.example and tRPC infrastructure]

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture**:
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for unit and integration tests [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical logic [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test File Location**: Co-located with components or in `src/test/` directory [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Types**: Component rendering, API integration, business logic, responsive design [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Testing Patterns**: Mock tRPC calls, test date filtering logic, verify empty states [Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]
