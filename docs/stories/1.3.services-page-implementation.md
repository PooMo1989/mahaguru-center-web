## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion: Excellent foundation established with Next.js 15, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS 4, and comprehensive testing setup using Vitest. All tooling and deployment pipeline confirmed working. Navigation component is fully responsive and ready for integration. [Source: Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]

### Project Structure Information
Based on established source tree, new pages should be placed in:
- Services page: `src/app/services/page.tsx` using App Router structure
- Navigation component: Available at `src/components/navigation` directory
- Existing layout.tsx provides the root layout structure [Source: architecture/10-source-tree.md]


### Content Requirements
[Source: UI/UX Specification & Project Brief]
The Services page must display all seven services in a clean, block-style layout. Each service block must contain a relevant image, the full unabridged description paragraph, and a call-to-action button. The exact text for each service is as follows:

**1. Dhamma Discussion**
Our signature monthly **Dhamma Discussion** is a cornerstone event held on the full moon Poya day, drawing over a hundred curious seekers of truth. The session begins with a profound talk by Mahaguru, followed by co-facilitated breakout discussions with Rev. Bhaddiya and Nevil Guru to explore the teachings more deeply. In addition to this monthly gathering, our Arahathmaga center hosts numerous sessions almost daily for advanced practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding.

**2. Dhamma Explanation**
For those seeking deeper clarity, our **Dhamma Explanation** sessions are led by the venerable Dodangoda Bhaddiya Thero. In these sessions, the profound Dhamma delivered by Mahaguru is carefully broken down into smaller, more digestible segments. Ven. Bhaddiya Thero provides extended explanations and insights, making these deep concepts accessible to all who wish to learn.

**3. Meditation Guidance**
Advance your spiritual journey with personalized **Meditation Guidance** from Nevil Guru. These on-demand sessions are tailored to provide individualized support for practitioners at all levels. Whether you are a beginner taking your first steps or an advanced practitioner seeking to overcome a specific hurdle, you can book a one-on-one or a group session with Nevil Guru to receive the dedicated guidance you need.

**4. Mahaguru Meetup**
The **Mahaguru Meetup** offers a rare and unique opportunity to connect directly with Mahaguru, either in person or online. These dedicated sessions are designed for individuals seeking profound clarity on pressing personal matters, career decisions, or pivotal life choices. This offering also extends to corporate teams, providing invaluable insights into the deeper nature of the human psyche to foster collaboration, enhance team dynamics, and achieve higher levels of organizational success.

**5. Weekly Clarity Q&A**
Join our interactive **Weekly Clarity Q&A** session, a supportive space for both new and experienced followers to find answers. Whether you have questions about your personal practice or seek to clarify concepts from our Dhamma discussions, this is your opportunity to engage directly with our facilitators. The session is expertly guided by Rev. Dodangoda Bhaddiya and Nevil Guru, with Mahaguru often in attendance to provide deeper insights where needed. It's the perfect forum to resolve doubts and gain confidence on your spiritual path.

**6. Gen Alpha Academy**
The **Gen Alpha Academy** is a visionary non-profit initiative by the Mahaguru Center, dedicated to shaping a better tomorrow by empowering today’s youth. This academy focuses on nurturing a new generation of conscious, capable, and compassionate leaders through specialized programs that instill wisdom and mindfulness from an early age.

**7. Outreach**
Our commitment to compassion extends beyond the center's walls through our community **Outreach** programs. We conduct dedicated sessions in prisons, hospitals, and other community spaces where the healing power of deep listening and mindfulness is needed most, offering support and solace to vulnerable populations.
