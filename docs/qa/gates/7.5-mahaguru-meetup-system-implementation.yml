# Issues requiring attention before production
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "BookingWidget component tests completely failing due to interface mismatch"
    suggested_action: "Update test suite to match actual component interface (serviceId prop vs amount prop)"
  - id: "TEST-002" 
    severity: medium
    finding: "24 failing tests across services page and admin components"
    suggested_action: "Align implementation with test expectations or update test assertions"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Complex animation system may impact performance on lower-end devices"
    suggested_action: "Add performance monitoring and consider optimization for mobile devices"
